# ink-smart-contract
Sample ink! smart contract for deployment on Substrate-based chain, written in Rust.

# status:
This project is in progress, and the contract is just a template.

# ink! version:
This contract was upgraded to ink! version 3.0. Since the framework is under continuous development, it is not backwards-compatible to earlier versions of the ink! / "cargo contracts" compiler to the best of my knowledge.

# functions:
cargo +nightly contract build
cargo +nightly test 

# output directory for wasm:
target/ink/nftink.wasm
